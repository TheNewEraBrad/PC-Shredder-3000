# PC-Shredder-3000
A script that instantly destroys any PC so you don't have to!

Available in Windows and Linux flavors (no, I do not plan to add mac support)

System Requirements:

Windows 7 or later / Linux Kernel 5.0 and above

Tested on the following OSes:

Ubuntu 20.04

Arch Linux (I use Arch btw)

Windows 7 to 10

Installation:

For Windows users: Download the files as zip and extract, run destroy-win.bat (Or use git lmao)

For Linux users: Use git or Download as zip and run the following commands:

chmod +x destroy-linux.sh

./destroy-linux.sh

Enjoy a bricked PC!

Update: Working on an EXE File for the Windows ppl.

NOTE: I removed the EFI shredding due to it being pointless and extremely buggy on Windows 8 and below. Please understand.

NOTE 2: I won't really be updating this until something changes in Windows, the Linux Kernel or an error in the code so don't expect frequent updates.
